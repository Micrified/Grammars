Note: Last working on the testing functions for sets_test. 
Once that is done, we can delete the old forms and use the renamed one. 
Then we can work on translating parsed shit into the internal format, and using the sets.
The sets can be used to implement the other functionality.
Then you make an HTML translater and hook it into a website. 
boom done
